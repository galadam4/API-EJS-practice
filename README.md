These are exercises i've done to practice the implementation of API's with node and EJS framework.


To make these work, fork the folder, open terminal and navigate to correct folder, then write npm install
Make sure you have node installed, otherwise this won't work(!)
to check if you have node installed, type in terminal node -v
*files run on port 3000.
